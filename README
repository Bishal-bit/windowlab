WHAT IS WINDOWLAB?

WindowLab is a small and simple window manager of novel design.

It's click-to-focus, shares its window depth policy with the Amiga, and has a window resizing/reshaping method similar to that of 8-1/2 from Plan 9. WindowLab maintains the illusion of direct manipulation by constraining the mouse pointer when appropriate, ie when a window cannot be dragged any further in one direction. The pointer is also constrained vertically (effectively making the target menu items infinitely tall according to Fitts's law) when it's in the menubar to reduce pointing time.

No fundamental changes to functionality are planned, and future releases will consist of bug fixes and code tidying.

WindowLab is maintained by Nick Gravgaard (me at nickgravgaard.com). I'd love to know if you use this software, and comments, bug reports/fixes and screenshots are also welcome.



LICENCE

WindowLab is Free Software and has been released under the GPL. Please see the LICENCE file for more information. The licence for aewm (which includes that of 9wm) from which this code has been derived is included at the end of this README document.



HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

Before compiling, check the default (DEF_foo) options in windowlab.h, and the defines in the Makefile. DEF_FONT is of particular interest; make sure that it is defined to something that exists on your system. You can turn -DSHAPE off if you don't have the Shape extension, and -DMWM_HINTS on if you have the Lesstif or Motif headers installed.

"make" will compile everything, and "make install" will install it.

To make WindowLab your default window manager, edit your ~/.xinitrc file and change the last line to:

exec windowlab



HOW DO I USE IT?

WindowLab places a taskbar at the top of the screen and adds a bar to the top of each window. These bars consist of a draggable area, and three squares on the right hand side. From right to left, these squares close the window, toggle the windows Z order Amiga style (if it's not at the front, bring it to the front, otherwise send it to the back), and start a reshape action (after clicking the gadget, move the mouse to where you want the top-left hand corner of the window to be, and drag the mouse to set the bottom-right corner). Window titlebars must always be fully on-screen and cannot overlap the taskbar at the top of the screen (so if you want to get rid of a window quickly and don't want to send it to the back you should drag it downwards).

The taskbar should list all windows currently in use. Clicking on a windows taskbar item will give that window focus and act as a click on that windows middle-gadget - ie toggle that windows Z order (depth).

If you right click outside a client window, WindowLabs taskbar becomes a menubar. Releasing the right mouse button over a selected menu item will start a corresponding external program. The menu labels and commands are defined in either ~/.windowlab/menurc or /etc/X11/windowlab/menurc if the first file cannot be opened.

An example menurc file is included (menurc.sample). Each line in the menurc file should have the menu label, a colon, and then the corresponding command, ie:

The GIMP:gimp

WindowLab positions new windows (that don't specify their location) according to the coordinates of the mouse - the top-left hand corner of a new window is set to the location of the mouse pointer (if necessary the window will be moved to ensure that all of it is on the screen).

WindowLab has the following keyboard controls. Hold Alt and press:
F9 to give focus to the previous window
F10 to give focus to the next window
F11 to toggle fullscreen mode on and off for non transient windows. This may be useful for watching video applications
F12 to toggle the windows depth. This is the same as pressing a windows middle button

Please email me at nickgravgaard.com. If you know how to fix it, even better.



ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to Decklin Foster who wrote the original aewm (v1.1.2 to be precise) on which WindowLab is based. He's done a superb job of writing a minimal window manager and was good enough to release it under a liberal licence that allows anyone to add their favourite GPL or BSD flavour as they see fit.
